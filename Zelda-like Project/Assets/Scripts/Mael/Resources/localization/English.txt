io1s1=The perfectly circular trace of what seems to be a powerful blast gives the still smoking remains a supernatural look. Or is it just the marks of the two huge wings that are bordering the corpse?
io1s2=Something very particular emerges from this corpse. Its proximity causes a weird feeling, like a mixture of a deep nostalgia and and unjustified fluffiness? An almost painful heat also emanates from the shining dust that surrounds the remains.
